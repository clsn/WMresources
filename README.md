# WMresources
Resources for users of the WatchMaker program for Android

I hope to collect some useful programming tips, actual pieces of code, images, and other tools for WatchMaker users.  This project is *always* a work in progress.  Please feel free to contribute, either via email or via github cloning and forking, etc.

This README file will, I hope, be expanded in the future.
