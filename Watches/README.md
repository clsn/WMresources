# Sample Watches

These watchfaces aren't here to be downloaded onto your watch so you can impress people with their beauty.  They're here for you to pick apart and look at and take ideas and parts from to add to your own creations.

* [second-examples.watch](../raw/master/Watches/second-examples.watch): A bunch of second hands, each doing its own thing.  Various possible second hand movements, some nice, some perhaps weird, but sometimes weird is a good thing.  I'll probably have to expand to a second example watch soon...
